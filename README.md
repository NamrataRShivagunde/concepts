# Concepts
Concepts of various topics in mathematics and AI

TOOLSETS:

Stage 1 :
Python Libraries:
Get a hands-on with these libraries in the given sequence. To do so, open the given library jupyter notebook and cheatsheet pdf e.g. if you want to get hands-on numpy library, open numpy.ipnyb and numpy_cheatsheet.pdf  . numpy.ipnyb is the hands-on version of the numpy_cheatsheet.

Cheat sheets reference :https://www.datacamp.com/community/data-science-cheatsheets

1. Numpy  
refer: nump.ipnyb, numpy_cheatsheet
2. Pandas
